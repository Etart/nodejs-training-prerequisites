## Git Installation

Using APT, you can also install [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

To get started, run the following command.

```
sudo apt-get install -y git
```

**TIP:** If you've been following along this guide, git may already be installed. :+1:

Once it finishes, run the following command.

```
git --version
```

You'll see the version of git installed at the prompt.

### Git Config

Like artists, programmers sign their work. Let's configure Git to sign your commits with your name and email address.

**WARNING:** Before running the following commands, replace `YOUR FULL NAME` and `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS` with the name and email from [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/profile).

```
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

### Congratulations, you're all finished!
