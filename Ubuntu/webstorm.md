### WebStorm Installation

** Prerequisites: **
Before installing WebStorm, we'll need Java installed. During the [apt-get](apt.md) part of the prerequisites setup we've already added the ppa for Java. So install Java with the following command.

```
sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
```

** Installation: **

Now installing WebStorm isn't the standard apt-get process unfortunately. First, download WebStorm from Jetbrains @ https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/

Once downloaded unzip (command below) the WebStorm directory to where you want WebStorm installed.

```
tar xfz WebStorm-*.tar.gz
```

From there you can now run WebStorm by executing the webstorm.sh file.

```
./webstorm.sh
```
