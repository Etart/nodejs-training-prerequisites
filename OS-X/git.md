### Install Git

Using Homebrew, you can also install [Git](http://git-scm.com/), the version control system of choice among choosy developers. :neckbeard:

To get started, run the following command.

```
brew install git
```

Once it finishes, run the following command.

```
git --version
```

And you'll see something like this.

### Git Config

Like artists, programmers sign their work. Let's configure Git to sign your commits with your name and email address.

**WARNING:** Before running the following commands, replace `YOUR FULL NAME` and `YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS` with the name and email from [your GitHub account](https://github.com/settings/profile).

```
git config --global user.name 'YOUR FULL NAME'
git config --global user.email 'YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS'
```

```

### Congratulations!

You're all set!
